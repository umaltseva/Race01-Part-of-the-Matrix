# Race01-Part-of-the-Matrix

Our team's solution for Race 01.

Made with [Oleksandr Trufanov](https://github.com/Abetth).

### DESCRIPTION

Create a program that decodes all valid variations of an encrypted math expression


The program takes four arguments:

• integer operands: *operand1* and *operand2*

• operation *operation*

• result of the math operation *result*

Your encoder must support four math operations: 
- addition **+** 

- subtraction **-**

- multiplication **"*"**

- division **/**

```
Operands and the result may consist of hidden digits marked by **?** character.
One digit per one **?**.
The program must not print zeros if they are before a full number.
You need to find out which digits are hidden by **?**  in order to maintain a mathematical expression valid. 
The program must output all valid variations (one per line).
```
